# SimpleSwap

A minimalistic swap user interface that allows to swap from XianPazA tokens to XianPazB tokens. Only this direction is available. 

## üåê Using the UI

When connecting to the wallet, it shows token balances and the price from the pool.

When user inputs the amount of XianPazA tokens to swap, it calculates the correlative amount of XianPazB tokens to receive (doing a call to the swap contract).

Finally, hitting the Swap button, an allowance is issued and then the swap operation. Once swap has been made, balances and price are updated.

You can find a live demo [here](https://simpleswapwithui.netlify.app/).

## üöÄ Implementation Details

In case you want to experiment in hardhat local node, please use `hardhat.local.config.js` as your `hardhat.config.js`. `hardhat.config.js` points to sepolia.

### Local Hardhat Environment

a) Run hardhat node

`npx hardhat node`: Starts a HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http://127.0.0.1:8545/

b) Compile contracs in local node

`npx hardhat compile`

c) Deploy contracts in local node

`npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`: Deploys each contract and builds the metadata used by the webapp, that is, the deploy address and the abi.

d) Mint tokens and add liquidy to the pool

`npx hardhat run scripts/addLiquidity.js --network localhost`

### Sepolia Environment

a) Environment Variables

In order to properly point to sepolia, you must provide the following addresses in your `.env` file:

`ALCHEMY_API_KEY` = API key for an alchemy node in Sepolia.
`SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` = Wallet address which will be used to deploy which needs to have enough gas to pay for them.
`ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` = API key used to verify contracts.

These settings will allow `hardhat.config.js` to direct to sepolia.

b) Compile contracs in local node

`npx hardhat compile`

c) Deploy contracts in local node

`npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia`: Deploys each contract and builds the metadata used by the webapp, that is, the deploy address and the abi.

d) Mint tokens and add liquidy to the pool

`npx hardhat run scripts/addLiquidity.js --network sepolia`

### Web UI launch

a) Run in localhost

`node server.js`: This runs the server launching the swap UI in `localhost:3000`

b) Run in Netlify

`https://simpleswapwithui.netlify.app/`: The webapp is published in this public URL.

## ü§ñ Contract Overview
SimpleSwap is a simple smart contract for token swaps and liquidity management, inspired by Uniswap v1. This contract allows users to:

- Add liquidity for a single token pair
- Remove liquidity proportionally
- Swap between two ERC20 tokens
- Query prices and output estimates

The repo contains the two token contracts:

- XianPazTokenA & XianPazTokenB: mintable ERC20s, 18 decimals created with openZeppelin library.

You can find these contracts deployed and verified in Sepolia in the following addresses:

- XianPazTokenA -> 0x231e356AaC9b22c313E8A0697d055453F226a153
- XianPazTokenB -> 0xB99512678b8aE7a9D31529C24716fA2d1e757Ac6
- SimpleSwap -> 0x78BaB5A34B32a8E0A0A537ffB176F03157477846

All contracts deployed with wallet address -> 0xB78A3BF33E12C5c61d117204A0cABFDb9B65776D

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This implementation supports only one fixed pair of tokens, without fees. It's meant for learning, experimentation, and educational purposes‚Äînot production use.

## üìÑ Contract Details

- **Token Pair**: Fixed at deployment via constructor (`tokenA`, `tokenB`)
- **Liquidity Tracking**: Custom liquidity shares tracked via internal bookkeeping
- **Formula**: Uses the constant product AMM formula: `x * y = k`
- **Fee**: No fee mechanism implemented
- **Math**: Includes custom `sqrt` and `min` helper functions
